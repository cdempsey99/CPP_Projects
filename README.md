### About Me
Hi, my name is Callum Dempsey and I'm a software developer currently working in the area of data capture systems for financial clients. I have an undergraduate 
degree in Theoretical Physics from Trinity College Dublin and so I have a strong mathematical background. During this time I gained some experience with 
Python and C++, and I am currently trying to improve my Python skills. 
  
  However my professional experience centres around [kdb+](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/), the world's fastest time series database.
This is the perfect tool for the fast-paced environment of the financial markets, where every millisecond counts. Since 2021 I have been expanding my knowledge with 
various multinational banks as clients. 

### Projects
In this repository you can see some side projects I've found interesting, including physical simulation assignments from my degree and some Advent of Code challenges.
